# Orb Fivetran Sync

This is the source code for the FiveTran [function](https://fivetran.com/docs/functions) that is used to sync data from the [Orb](https://orb.dev) platform to a destination of your choice.

FiveTran setup can be done from their [instructions](https://fivetran.com/docs/functions/google-cloud-functions/setup-guide#beginfivetranconfiguration), which involves creating a cloud function and deploying this source code. Further details about Orb data exports are [here](https://docs.withorb.com/guides/integrations-and-exports/data-exports#export-method).
